# Nifty-Mix-Match
This aim of this app is to simplify the process of buying clothes.


## Using it
Use Android Studio to run the Flutter app.
Run the flask server (app.py) together with it


## How it should work
The flutter app would interact with the backend flask server to retrieve the images. It would then pass the user data to the backend where it would train the model specifically for the user. With a recommender system, it would then recommend the user an outfit. Unfortunately, most of the features are a work in progress.
